Fig1-1,"Predicted IC50 values (in the log(uM) scale) and reference ranges of real (GDSC) data and DeepDR prediction across all cell lines (n=622), as well as prediction of tumors (TCGA; n=9,059). The table also shows target genes, mechanisms of action information, and PubChem CID and annotation of all 265 anti-cancer drugs."
Fig1-2,Waterfall plot of predicted IC50 values for the query sample across 265 compounds.
Fig1-3,2D structure of the compound selected from Panel 1-1 and drug information.
Fig1-4,"Density plot of IC50 values of the selected drug across all pan-cancer cell lines (n=704) or TCGA tumors (n=9,059). For cell lines, the plot includes real IC50 values from GDSC data and predicted values generated by DeepDR; for tumors, we use predicted IC50 values across TCGA tumors as reported in Chiu et al. BMC Medical Genomics 2019. Predicted IC50 of the query sample is denoted by a vertical line. The plot demonstrates how the query sample compares to all other samples."
Fig1-5,"Box plot of real and/or predicted IC50 values of the selected drug across different cancer types, in comparison to that of the query sample. The plot demonstrates how the query sample compares to samples of different cancer types."

Fig1-7,"Drug-sample association network of the selected drug and its top responding samples. When a user selects a drug of interest, a network is created with the drug being the hub, 10 most sensitive samples to the drug as the first-degree nodes, and 10 most effective drugs of each sample as the second-degree nodes. The network is constructed using the real GDSC data for cell lines and DeepDR-predicted data for tumors."
Fig2-1,"Similar cell lines/tumors to the query sample. Similarity is measured by the Jaccard index for mutations (overlap) and Pearson correlation for expression data (concordance)."
Fig2-2,"Sample-drug association network of the query sample, its similar CCLE/TCGA samples, and the top sensitive drugs. The network is created with the query being the hub, 10 top similar samples as the first-degree nodes, and 10 most effective drugs of each sample as the second-degree nodes. The network is constructed using the real GDSC data for cell lines and DeepDR-predicted data for tumors."
